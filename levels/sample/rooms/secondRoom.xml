<!-- This file describes the first room. Normally I break each room into its
own self-contained file. This isn't fundamentally necessary, but it's very
natural. It also allows you to very easily load content only once a room

    <!-- The map is a special black-and-white image describing walkable areas in
	a room. White pixels are walkable, black are unwalkable. This actually consumes
	a very large amount of memory to use, so we keep the scaled down. I find 50%
	scale is a good compromise for performance/accuracy. However in sufficiently
	large rooms this is still too much, and 25% scale in necessary. This leads to
	a substantial sarcifice in hit-detection quality, so avoid big rooms!-->

	the dimensions of the room from this, which is used to specify the area the

   <!-- here we're adding in our BG and FG. This is the second half of our 
   optimization. To avoid creating a dozen sprites for every single tile, we
   specify that this image has been sliced up into tiles. Then we just specify
   how many there are and how big they are, and the system will find all of them
   and tile them correctly based on their names. This also makes it very easy
   to transition from using one big image to a sliced up one. -->
