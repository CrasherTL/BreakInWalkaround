	<!-- The map is a special black-and-white image describing walkable areas in
	a room. White pixels are walkable, black are unwalkable. This actually consumes
	a very large amount of memory to use, so we keep the scaled down. I find 50%
	scale is a good compromise for performance/accuracy. However in sufficiently
	large rooms this is still too much, and 25% scale in necessary. This leads to
	a substantial sarcifice in hit-detection quality, so avoid big rooms!-->

<!-- We create the sprite for this item outside of everything else

   optimization. To avoid creating a dozen sprites for every single tile, we
   specify that this image has been sliced up into tiles. Then we just specify
   how many there are and how big they are, and the system will find all of them
   and tile them correctly based on their names. This also makes it very easy
   to transition from using one big image to a sliced up one. -->
